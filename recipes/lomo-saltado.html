    <h3>Lomo saltado recipe</h3>
    <p>Lomo saltado is a popular, traditional Peruvian dish, a stir fry that typically combines marinated strips of sirloin (or other beef steak) 
        with onions, tomatoes, french fries, and other ingredients; and is typically served with rice. The dish originated as part of 
        the chifa tradition, the Chinese cuisine of Peru, though its popularity has made it part of the mainstream culture.
