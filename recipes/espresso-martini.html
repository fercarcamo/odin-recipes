    <h3>Red Mojo Sauce Recipe</h3>
    <p>The espresso martini, also known as a vodka espresso, is a cold caffeinated alcoholic drink made with espresso, coffee liqueur, 
        and vodka. It is not a true martini as it contains neither gin nor vermouth, but is one of many drinks that incorporate the term 
        martini into their names.
